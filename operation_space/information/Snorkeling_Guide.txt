Part 3: Crucial Precautions

LOOK, DON'T TOUCH: Protect yourself and the environment. Coral is sharp, fragile, and can contain stinging organisms. Many marine animals can bite or sting in defense.
Conserve Energy: Don't fight currents. If you feel tired, turn back or signal your buddy.
Stay Hydrated: Snorkeling is exercise! Drink plenty of water beforehand.
Know Your Limits: Don't hyperventilate (taking huge breaths before diving) to try to stay down longer. This can lead to shallow-water blackout.
Be Aware of Your Surroundings: Regularly look up to check your position relative to your entry/exit point and to watch for boat traffic.

**Most importantly, relax, breathe slowly, and enjoy the beautiful view!**
